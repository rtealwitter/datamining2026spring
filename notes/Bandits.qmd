The fundamental tension in reinforcement learning (and perhaps in life more generally) is between exploration and exploitation.
On one hand, we want to exploit what we know to maximize our reward.
On the other, we want to explore new actions to discover their potential rewards.
Today, we will explore this tension in the context of a simplified reinforcement learning model: multi-armed bandits.

In a multi-armed bandit problem, we have a set of $k$ actions (or "arms") to choose from, each with an unknown probability distribution of rewards.
At each time step $t \in \{1,\ldots,T\}$, we choose one arm to pull $a^{(t)} \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$.
We then receive a reward $r_{a^{(t)}} \in [-1,1]$ drawn from chosen arm $a^{(t)}$.
Define the expected reward of arm $a$ as $\mu_a = \mathbb{E}[r_a]$.

Our goal is to minimize the *average regret*, compared to the optimal arm:
$$
R_T = \max_{a \in \{1,\ldots, k\}} \mu_a - \frac1{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \mu_{a^{(t)}},
$$
The challenge is balancing exploration (trying out different arms to learn their rewards) with exploitation (choosing the arm that currently seems best).
Our solution will be "optimism in the face of uncertainty"; that is, giving each arm a *reasonable* benefit of the doubt when picking the best option.

### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

Since we initially have no information about the arms, we use the first $k$ time steps to sample each arm once.
From then on, we will maintain an estimate $\tilde{\mu}_a^{(t)}$ of the expected reward for each arm based on the reward we observed from all previous time steps $1,\ldots, t-1$.

We will also maintain a confidence bound $\epsilon_a^{(t)}$ for each arm, which quantifies the uncertainty of our estimate.
Formally, we expect $\mu_a - \tilde{\mu}_a^{(t)} \leq \epsilon_a^{(t)}$ with high probability.
At each time step $t$, we will choose the arm with the highest upper confidence bound:
$$
a^{(t)} = \arg \max_{a} \tilde{\mu}_a^{(t)} + \epsilon_a^{(t)}.
$$

We will choose the confidence intervals so that the probability that our estimate deviates from the true mean by more than the confidence bound *at any point in the algorithm* is at most a user-defined parameter $\delta$.

The following technical lemma will help us analyze the algorithm.

**Lemma** For all time steps $t \in \{k+1, \ldots, T\}$ and arms $a \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$, with probability $1-\delta$, we have
$$
|\mu_a - \tilde{\mu}_a^{(t)}| \leq \epsilon_a^{(t)} = \sqrt{\frac{2\log(\frac{2T k}{\delta})}{n_a^{(t)}}}
$$
where $n_a^{(t)}$ is the number of times arm $a$ has been pulled up to time $t$ i.e., $n_a^{(t)} = \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} \mathbb{1}(a^{(s)} = a)$.

We will apply [Hoeffding's inequality](Concentration.html#hoeffding) to bound the estimation error.

Consider $n$ independent random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ that such that $a \leq X_i \leq b$ for all $i$. Let $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ be the sample mean, and $\mu = \mathbb{E}[\bar{X}]$ be the expected value of the sample mean.
Recall Hoeffding's inequality: For any $\epsilon > 0$,
$$
\Pr\left(|\mathbb{E}[\bar{X}] - \bar{X}| \geq \epsilon\right) \leq 2 \exp\left(-\frac{2n\epsilon^2}{(b-a)^2}\right).
$$
In our setting, the rewards are bounded between $-1$ and $1$, so we have $a = -1$ and $b = 1$.
Setting the failure probability to $\frac{\delta}{T k}$ and solving for $\epsilon$,
we get
$$
\begin{align}
2\exp\left(-\frac{2 {n} \epsilon^2}{4}\right)
&= \frac{\delta}{T k}
\\ \frac{{n} \epsilon^2}{2}
&= \log\left(\frac{2T k}{\delta}\right)
\\ \epsilon
&= \sqrt{\frac{2 \log\left(\frac{2T k}{\delta}\right)}{n}}.
\end{align}
$$

Applying Hoeffding's inequality, and this choice of $\epsilon$, to our reward estimation problem for a particular arm $a$ and time step $t$, we get
$$
\Pr\left(|\mu_a - \tilde{\mu}_a^{(t)}| \geq \epsilon_a^{(t)}\right) \leq \frac{\delta}{T k}.
$$

We want this inequality to hold simultaneously for all arms and all time steps.
Union bounding over all $Tk$ events yields

$$
\Pr \left(
  \bigcup_{t=1}^{T} \bigcup_{a=1}^{k} \left\{ |\mu_a - \tilde{\mu}_a^{(t)}| \geq \epsilon_a^{(t)} \right\}
\right)
\leq \sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{a=1}^k \frac{\delta}{T k}
= \delta.
$$

With the lemma in hand, we are now ready to prove the regret guarantee of the UCB algorithm.
Let $a^*$ be the optimal arm, i.e., the arm with the highest expected reward $\mu_{a^*} = \max_{a} \mu_a$.

**Regret Theorem:**
The average regret of the UCB algorithm satisfies:
$$
\mu_{a^*} - \frac1{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \mu_{a^{(t)}}
= O\left(\frac{k}{T} + \sqrt{\log\left(\frac{T k}{\delta}\right)} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{T}}\right)
= \tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{T}}\right).
$$

Note that the logarithmic term is always small; for example, $\log_{10}(\# \text{atoms in the universe}) \approx \log_{10}(10^{80}) = 80$.

Since the multi-armed bandit problem is only interesting for $T \gg k$, the average regret is dominated by the second term, which decays as $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k/T})$ where the $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides log factors.
In words, increasing the number of steps by a factor of 100 decreases the average regret by a factor of 10.
Conversely, increasing the number of arms by a factor of 100 only increases the average regret by a factor of 10.

Up to logarithmic factors, the UCB algorithm gives the best possible guarantee:
That is, there are instances where the average regret grows at a rate of $\Omega(\sqrt{k/T})$ for all possible strategies (see e.g., Chapter 2 in [Regret Analysis of Stochastic and
Nonstochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.5721)).

<summary>Proof of Regret Theorem</summary>

We will first bound the difference between the reward of the optimal action $a^*$ and the reward of the action chosen by the algorithm $a^{(t)}$ at time $t$.
By the lemma and the greedy choice of $a^{(t)}$, we have:
$$
\mu_{a^*}
\leq 
\tilde{\mu}_{a^*}^{(t)} + \epsilon_{a^*}^{(t)}
\leq \tilde{\mu}_{a^{(t)}}^{(t)} + \epsilon_{a^{(t)}}^{(t)}
\leq \mu_{a^{(t)}} + 2 \epsilon_{a^{(t)}}^{(t)}.
$$
Subtracting $\mu_{a^{(t)}}$ from both sides, we get
$$
\mu_{a^*} - \mu_{a^{(t)}}
\leq 2 \epsilon_{a^{(t)}}^{(t)}
= 2 \sqrt{\frac{2\log(\frac{2T k}{\delta})}{n_a^{(t)}}}.
$$

Summing over all but the first $k$ time steps,
$$
\sum_{t=k+1}^T \mu_{a^*} - \mu_{a^{(t)}}
\leq \sum_{t=k+1}^T 2 \sqrt{\frac{2\log(\frac{2T k}{\delta})}{n_a^{(t)}}}
= 2 \sqrt{2\log\left(\frac{2T k}{\delta}\right)} \sum_{t=k+1}^T \frac{1}{\sqrt{n_a^{(t)}}}.
$$
We can write the inner summation as
$$
\sum_{t=k+1}^T \frac{1}{\sqrt{n_a^{(t)}}} 
= \sum_{a=1}^k \sum_{i=1}^{n_a^{(T)}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}}
\leq \sum_{a=1}^k 2 \sqrt{n_a^{(T)}}
\leq 2 \sqrt{T k},
$$
where the first inequality follows by upper bounding the sum with an integral, and the second inequality follows from [Cauchy-Schwarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality). Do you see how?

Then, the *average* regret is

$$
\frac1{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \mu_{a^*} - \mu_{a^{(t)}}
\leq 2 \frac{k}{T} +\frac1{T} \sum_{t=k+1}^T \mu_{a^*} - \mu_{a^{(t)}}
= 2 \frac{k}{T} + 4 \sqrt{2\log\left(\frac{2T k}{\delta}\right)} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{T}}.
$$
