When I first heard about machine *learning*, I imagined a computer that was rewarded every time it gave the right answer. Maybe there were electric carrots and sticks that no one had bothered to tell me about? While I now know as little as I did then about computer hardware, I have learned that machine learning is fundamentally a mathematical process.

Luckily, we've been learning about the very mathematical ideas that make machine learning work for years! We'll review the basics of these concepts here.

### Derivatives

Consider a function ${f}: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.
The mapping notation means that ${f}$ takes a single real number as input and outputs a single real number.
In general, mathematicians tell us to be careful about whether we can differentiate a function.
But, we're computer scientists so we'll risk it for the biscuit.

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ be the input to ${f}$.
The derivative of ${f}$ with respect to its input $x$ is mathematically denoted by $f'(x) = \frac{d}{d x}[{f}(x)]$.

Formally, the derivative is defined as
$$
\frac{d}{d x}[{f}(x)]
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{{f}(x + h) - {f}(x)}{h}.
$$
If we were to plot ${f}$, the derivative at a point $x$ would be the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.

Here are several examples of functions and their derivatives that you might remember from calculus.

### Chain Rule and Product Rule

While working with a simple basic function is easy, we're not always so lucky.
Modern machine learning chains many many complicated functions together.
Fortunately, we will think of these operations modularly.

Let $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be another function.
Consider the composite function $g({f}(x))$.

By the chain rule, the derivative of $g({f}(x))$ with respect to $x$ is
$$
\frac{d}{d x}[g({f}(x))]
= g'(f(x)) f'(x).
$$

Often, we will also multiply functions together.
The product rule tells us that
$$
\frac{d}{d x}[g(x) {f}(x)]
= g(x) \frac{d}{d x}[{f}(x)]
+ {f}(x) \frac{d}{d x}[g(x)].
$$

### Gradients

In machine learning, we process high-dimensional data so we are interested in functions with multivariate input.
Consider ${f}: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$.
The output of the function is still a real number but the input consists of $d$ real numbers.
We will use the vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ to represent all $d$ inputs $x_1, \ldots, x_d$.

Instead of the derivative, we will use the partial derivative.
The partial derivative with respect to $x_i$ is denoted by $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}[{f}(\mathbf{x})]$.
In effect, the partial derivative tells us how ${f}$ changes when we change $x_i$, while keeping all other inputs fixed.

The gradient stores all the partial derivatives in a vector.
The $i$th entry of this vector is given by the partial derivative of ${f}$ with respect to $x_i$.
In mathematical notation,
$$
\nabla_\mathbf{x} {f} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}[{f}(\mathbf{x})] \\ \vdots \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_d}[{f}(\mathbf{x})] \\ \end{smallmatrix}\right]
$$

Just like the derivative in one dimension, the gradient contains information about the slope of ${f}$ with respect to each of the $d$ dimensions in its input.

### Vector and Matrix Multiplication

Vector and matrix multiplication lives at the heart of machine learning.
In fact, neural networks only really started to take off when researchers realized that the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) could be used to perform gradient updates in addition to the matrix multiplication it was designed to do for gaming.

Consider two vectors $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d$.
We will use $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^d u_i v_i$ to denote the inner product of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$.
We can also write the inner product as $\mathbf{u}^\top \mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{u}^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times d}$ is the transpose of $\mathbf{u}$.
The $\ell_2$-norm of $\mathbf{v}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{v}\|_2 = \sqrt{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}}$.

Consider two matrices: $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times m}$ and $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ where $d \neq n$.
We can only multiply two matrices when their *inner* dimension agrees.
Because the number of columns in $\mathbf{A}$ is the same as the number of rows in $\mathbf{B}$, we can compute $\mathbf{AB}$.
However, because the number of columns in $\mathbf{B}$ is not the same as the number of rows in $\mathbf{A}$, the product $\mathbf{BA}$ is not defined.

When we *can* multiply two matrices, the $(i,j)$ entry in $\mathbf{AB}$ is given by the inner product between the $i$th row of $\mathbf{A}$ and the $j$th column of $\mathbf{B}$.
In mathematical notation, we write
$$
[\mathbf{AB}]_{i,j} = \sum_{k=1}^m [\mathbf{A}]_{i,k} [\mathbf{B}]_{k,j}.
$$
The resulting dimensions of the matrix product will be the number of rows in $\mathbf{A}$ by the number of columns in $\mathbf{B}$.

Beyond this inner product matrix multiplication that we are used to from linear algebra, there is also an *outer product* way to multiply two matrices.
Consider the index $k \in \{1, \ldots, m\}$.
Let $[\mathbf{A}]_{,k}$ denote the $k$th column of $\mathbf{A}$ and $[\mathbf{B}]_{k,}$ denote the $k$th row of $\mathbf{B}$.
We can write the matrix product as a sum of outer products for each $k$:
$$
\mathbf{AB} = \sum_{k=1}^m [\mathbf{A}]_{,k} [\mathbf{B}]_{k,}.
$$
By checking the $(i,j)$ entry of the outer product, we see that the outer product definition is equivalent to the inner product matrix multiplication.
We will soon see that this outer product definition is a surprisingly useful way to think about matrix multiplication.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
The primary challenge when dealing with matrices is that our favorite operations on scalar real numbers do not always work on matrices.
For example, it's not obvious how to divide one matrix by another, or how to take the square root of a matrix.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide a way to decompose matrices into simpler components that we can work with in more familiar ways.

Consider a square and symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$.
As we may remember from linear algebra, an eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}$ is a vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\mathbf{Av} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$ for some scalar $\lambda$.
Let $r$ be the *rank*, i.e., the number of eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues (counting multiplicity). 
Then, we can write the eigenvectors as $\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_r$, with corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \geq \ldots \geq \lambda_r$.
The eigenvectors are orthonormal, meaning that $\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j = 0$ for $i \neq j$ and $\|\mathbf{v}_i\|_2 = 1$ for all $i$.

Given these properties, we can write
$$\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^\top$$
where $\mathbf{V} = [\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_r] \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ is the matrix of eigenvectors and $\mathbf{\Lambda} = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_r) \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
This decomposition is known as the *eigenvalue decomposition* of $\mathbf{A}$.

Using our outer product definition of matrix multiplication, we can equivalently write the eigenvalue decomposition as
$$\mathbf{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^\top$$
where $\mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^\top$ is the outer product of the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_i$ with itself.
We can check that the eigenvalue decomposition is correct by multiplying by each eigenvector.
Since the eigenvectors are orthonormal, we have $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i$ for each $i$.

### Matrix Inversion

Let's see the power of the eigenvalue decomposition in the context of matrix inversion.
If we have a scalar equation $ax = b$, we can simply solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by $a$.
In effect, we are applying the inverse of $a$ to $a$ i.e., $(a)^{-1} a =1$.
The same principle applies to matrices.
The $d \times d$ identity matrix generalizes the scalar identity $1$.
This identity matrix is denoted by $\mathbf{I}_{d \times d} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$: the on-diagonal entries $(i,i)$ are 1 while the off-diagonal entries $(i,j)$ for $i\neq j$ are 0.

For a matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, we use $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ to denote its inverse.
(When $\mathbf{A}$ does not have full rank, i.e., $r < d$, the inverse is not defined, but we can still use the eigenvalue decomposition to find a pseudo-inverse.)
The inverse is defined so that $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_{d \times d}$ where $\mathbf{I}_{d \times d}$ is the identity matrix.
In terms of our eigenvalue decomposition, the inverse of $\mathbf{A}$ is given by
$$\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Lambda}^{-1} \mathbf{V}^\top$$
where $\mathbf{\Lambda}^{-1} = \text{diag}(\frac{1}{\lambda_1}, \ldots, \frac{1}{\lambda_r})$ is the diagonal matrix of the inverses of the eigenvalues.
To see this, note that:
$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \left(\mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Lambda}^{-1} \mathbf{V}^\top\right) \left(\mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^\top\right)
= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Lambda}^{-1} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^\top
= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{I}_{r \times r} \mathbf{V}^\top
= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{V}^\top
= \mathbf{I}_{d \times d},
$$
where we repeatedly used the fact that $\mathbf{V}^\top \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}_{r \times r}$ because the eigenvectors are orthonormal.
The last equality requires that the matrix is full rank, i.e., $r=d$.
If $r < d$, the inverse doesn’t exist; instead, the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse is 
$\mathbf{A}^{+} = \mathbf{V}\,\mathbf{\Lambda}^{+}\mathbf{V}^\top$
with 
$\mathbf{\Lambda}^{+} = \mathrm{diag}\!\left(\tfrac{1}{\lambda_1}, \ldots, \tfrac{1}{\lambda_r}\right).$

In our outer product form, we can write the inverse as
$$\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \sum_{i=1}^r \frac{1}{\lambda_i} \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^\top$$
where $\mathbf{v}_i$ are the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}$.
Can you more easily see why $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_{d \times d}$?

Going forward, we will apply the linear algebra tools we learned today to understand machine learning algorithms.
The first algorithm we will study is PageRank, which, at its foundation, simply uses the eigenvalue decomposition to find the most important pages on the internet.
